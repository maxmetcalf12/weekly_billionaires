  months. The first step: choosing a business."

We announced yesterday we are starting a new business with the goal of making $30k in three months. Awesome. The obvious next question is "well, what are we going to start?" To answer this, Rob and I did a brainstorm where we each brought three business ideas to the table. Here are those ideas.

**Rent a Ledge (Rob)** -- Big wall rock climbers have a ledge they need when they climb a big wall. Since most big wall climbers only climb a big wall requiring a ledge a few times, it makes sense to rent it instead of buying it. Start a company that rents out ledges to big wall climbers.

Positives: very niche, Rob is a big wall climber, actionable quickly

Negatives: very small market, big wall climbing is largely a spring sport, capital intensive

Grade: 6.5 

**Beautiful Books of Mormon (Max)** -- Books of Mormon, but prettier. I know these exist, but I think if you could make a really pretty Book of Mormon you could sell a bunch of them. Business model: D2C selling using social ads.

Positives: very niche, we are both Mormons, clear business model

Negatives: neither of us are physical artists, hard to do in three months

Grade: 6.6

**Financial Advisor Lead Vetting (Max)** -- I have a friend, Hunter, who is a financial advisor. I was at the gym with him one time talking about lead generation companies and he says he has a bunch reach out but it's hard to vet them and know if they're good. Business idea: create a marketplace for financial advisor leads where advisors can see reviews on lead generation companies and where we vet the leads are quality.

Positives: actionable relatively quickly, high willingness to pay

Negatives: few connections in industry, limited market size

Grade: 7.2

**Takeaways (Rob)** -- Rob is a freelance UX designer. He does a lot of interviews with customers and user research. He has noticed there is not a good way to share this user research, and especially the top takeaways, with clients. Idea: build software that makes it easy to share user research and key takeaways.

Positives: SaaS product, very high margin, niche industry, within our skillset

Negatives: hard (borderline impossible) to execute in three months

Grade: 7.5

**Mental Help (Rob)** -- Rob has been working on this idea for a while. The business is creating software that makes it easier for people to find a therapist they connect with. Finding the right therapist is hard, and the only resource for it is bad online search pages with little to no information or word of mouth referrals. Create software where therapists answer common questions and allow people to go through and see them like Tinder. 

Positives: awesome idea, huge impact, could be a large business, passionate about mental health

Negatives: hard to execute in three months, not immediately profitable

Grade: 8.8 overall, 7.8 for this project

**Christmas Lights Lead Generation (Max)** -- Now this is niche. Rob has a friend, Shane, who washes windows and hangs christmas lights. Rob and I both washed windows in high school as a summer job. Talking to Shane, the number one problem with Christmas Lights is not getting leads early enough in the season. Business idea: create websites to generate leads for Christmas Lights companies and sell those leads to the companies.

Positives: Christmas Lights companies have no online presence, immediately profitable, perfect timing

Negatives: not going to be a big business, required upfront capital (ads)

Grade: 8.2

We have made the decision to go with Christmas Lights Lead Generation. We fully recognize this is probably the smallest long-term opportunity of all our ideas, but it feels like the idea that is most realistic for our goal. The main reason we are picking it is we think we can get a relatively high dollar amount per lead ($50), and there is very little competition in the industry.

We're fishing in a stocked pond with only one other fisherman, the only problem is that all the fish are three inch trout. Since our goal is to catch a lot of pounds of fish, we think this is our best opportunity to make money quickly.

So from here on out, our blog posts and effort will be around starting a Christmas Light lead generation company! Stay tuned!
