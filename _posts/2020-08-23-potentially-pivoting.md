excerpt: We came up with a good idea related to Christmas light leads, and now
  we're thinking of pivoting.

Business is fun because you don't know where things are going until you dive in. 

Rob and I made the decision to start a lead generation company for Christmas light installation. We thought it was a good opportunity because the timing was right, the market was very niche, and online presence of competitors was weak. 

We spent an hour or so brainstorming potential ways to target houses and generate those leads. We don't really have time to trend on SEO and our budget is really small, so we have to get creative. We decided it would be a good idea to get a list of houses sold in the last year in the area we live and hang door hangers on their homes. Seemed like a great idea. 

So, we went online to find a list, and we didn't find a lot. We found out we could buy the list from utility companies, but it was relatively expensive ($.50 per home). Since I'm a developer, I looked if there were any APIs of home sales. I found a couple of them, and got pricing. I figured out I could get the list through these. 

Then I thought, if we think this is valuable for us, then it certainly will be valuable for existing christmas light installers and potentially all other home services (landscaping, window washing, painting, HVAC, etc.). So, we're going to try it. Next week, we're taking time to call 100 different home service companies and see if they would pay $100 for the list. For seasonal companies like Christmas Lights it would be a flat rate, and for non-seasonal companies a monthly fee of $50/month or something like that. 

The good part of this pivot is we can sell it before we make it. Then if we get enough demand, we can buy access to the API and start generating the lists and selling them. 

We'll obviously keep you posted on how it goes, but that is the update for today. Thanks for reading, wish us luck with selling.
