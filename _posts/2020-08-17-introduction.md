About a month ago, I was listening to an episode of my favorite podcast, [My First Million](https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/). They went on a bit of a tangent talking about an idea of how to make money as fast as possible. **The question they posed on the podcast was "if you had three months to make $3mm, what would you build?"**

One of the reasons I love podcasts (specifically My First Million) is it forces me to see the world of business from a different, much larger perspective. I thought to myself "if they're talking about making $3mm in three months, what is stopping me from starting a business to make some money, even if it is an order of magnitude less than $3mm?"

So, I called my brother [Rob](/authors/rob/). A little background, my brother is a UX designer and we have worked on a bunch of projects together at work (he freelances for my employer, Orca Health). He loved the idea, so we decided to talk about what a realistic goal for us was. Before setting a goal, we decided to set some criteria of what the business would be. Here are those criteria:

1. Must be strictly a side hustle, cannot take away hours from our current employer
2. Max money to start of $300
3. Max total money invested of $10k
4. Prioritize profit over growth

After setting these criteria, we came up with our goal: **3 months, $30,000.**

I realize this goal is very small compared to Sam and Shaan's discussion of $3mm, but $30k is enough money to have a material difference in each of our lives. If we can hit this goal, we'd be stoked. If we exceed it, that would be even better. If we fail, we fail.

We have also set the goal of documenting every step of the journey. We are planning on doing that through this blog, a podcast, and complete transparency to everything we do (within reason). I love transparency in business (Buffer), so we plan on sharing everything we do with everyone. If you're reading this far, thank you. Hopefully we can provide entertaining, informative content over the next three months!
