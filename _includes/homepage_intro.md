Inspired by Shaan and Sam on [My First Million](https://thehustle.co/my-first-million-podcast/), my brother Rob and I are starting a company with the vision of making as much money as possible in three months. The original challenge was $3mm in 3 months, but we are knocking that down 100 fold and shooting for $30,000.

This website is a blog tracking our progress. We release a daily blog article with our progress and take-aways. We are also working on a podcast to share our daily grind.
