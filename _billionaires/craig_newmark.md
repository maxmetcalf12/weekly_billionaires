## Who is Craig Newmark?

Craig was born into a Jewish family in New Jersey and attended a Jewish school growing up. His father died when he was 13 and he was raised by his mother after that. He went to Case Western Reserve University and graduated with a masters degree in 1977.

After graduating, he worked at IBM for 17 years as a developer. He moved to San Francisco to work for Charles Schwab in 1993 as a software engineer.

Throughout these years of work, Craig was involved in the early days of the internet. He spent time on early virtual communities like [The WELL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL), [MindVox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MindVox), and [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet). These communities served as inspiration for him in building Craigslist.

After moving to California, Craig found it difficult to meet people, so he decided to start an email newsletter with postings of events he thought would be interesting to software developers in San Francisco. Demand for his email built, as did postings that were featured on the newsletter, so he decided to build it into a website in 1996.

He slowly branched out into other categories like jobs and dating, but stayed focused in San Francisco for 4 years. Starting in 2000, he expanded to other US and Canadian cities. Today Craigslist serves over 70 countries and every major US city.

## Nerds rule the world

Craig is a self-proclaimed nerd. In fact, I sent out a tweet and he replied with this gem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks! Talking original 1950&#39;s style nerd, I really did wear a plastic pocket protector, and thick black glasses, taped together... <a href="https://t.co/FS06vyFWbs">https://t.co/FS06vyFWbs</a></p>&mdash; craig newmark (@craignewmark) <a href="https://twitter.com/craignewmark/status/1300803097669763072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I love nerds, I'm a math major myself and nothing is better than an upper level math class with a bunch of nerds. I wish I was more nerdy. Being a nerd helped Chris learn about computers in their very early days and get exposed to early virtual communities that later served as inspiration for Craigslist.

## It's not all about the money

From the early days of Craigslist, Craig has been adamant that his goal was not to make vast amounts of money. He obviously did very well for himself — he is on this billionaire list — but his goal was not to make money. He was happy providing a comfortable life for himself. I love the quote mentioned in the tweet above

> I admit that when I think of the money one could make from all this, I get a little twinge. But I'm pretty happy with nerd values: Get yourself a comfortable living, then do a little something to change the world.

From studying Craig's story, I think he has been consistently motivated by nerd values throughout the whole journey. Nerd values led him to make things on Craigslist largely open — he wanted to build a posting board that helped customers, not filter listings to meet certain criteria. The nerd value of being open and not moderated was a huge reason Craigslist has gotten as large as it is.

If Craig had wanted to make a ton of money, he certainly could have. I found this infographic that shows all the businesses that have "unbundled" Craigslist with more features and a prettier UI.

The combined value of all these companies is well over $1 trillion. But Craig did not want to build an empire, he wanted to build a simple posting board that helped people find what they needed. He stayed true to his nerd values and that is what I believe has made him such a large success.

## When to automate

In an interview on [This Week in Startups](https://www.notion.so/maxmetcalf/Podcast-Notes-abce28023c5f4dabb986d06aec72ba2a#2ca051f905424df9b8fd260a8d38fced), Craig talked briefly about the early days of Craigslist and how he was able to manage things without venture capital. He said his process in the early days to prioritize what to focus on from a software perspective was to automate tasks as soon as they were taking one hour per day.

I think this is a really good strategy. Often times in startups, founders and teams focus on making everything ready to scale before it **needs** to scale. Scaling too early is detrimental to many young companies. Waiting to automate allows a team to prioritize better and to better understand what customers are doing and what is happening within an app.

## Free journalism

If you follow Craig on Twitter, you'll clearly see what his passion is. He focuses most of his time these days on philanthropy and funds projects to protect journalism and prevent fake news. I love how he has taken such a specific task with his philanthropy and he seems to be making a real impact in the space.

## Conclusion

The main takeaway from studying Craig for a week: Craig is a genuinely nice guy with a strong moral code. He believes in free speech and has shown that through not regulating content on Craigslist and through his more recent philanthropic efforts.

Business learnings
* Customer service is most important
* Only automate when necessary
* Focus on product, not money

I had a fun time studying Craig. I love how he owns being a nerd. I have often been hesitant in life to fully embrace my nerdom but Craig is a good example of being true to who you are.
